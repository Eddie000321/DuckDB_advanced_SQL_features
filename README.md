# DuckDB Advanced SQL Practice

## Overview
This repository is a personal sandbox for rehearsing the SQL exercises from the CMU 15-445/645 Intro to Database Systems (Fall 2025) course while exploring DuckDB features. The work here is solely for learning purposes. All problem statements and supporting materials remain the intellectual property of Carnegie Mellon University.

## Assignment Source
- Official assignment descriptions and public handouts: https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/assignments.html
- The original assignment PDF is kept locally for reference only and is intentionally excluded from this repository.

## Repository Layout
- `q1_sample.duckdb.sql` â€“ `q6_upsert.duckdb.sql`: DuckDB SQL scripts for each exercise.
- `lahman-cmudb2025.db`: Lahman database snapshot distributed with the assignment.
- (Local-only) Assignment PDF: stored outside of version control to respect distribution policies.

## How to Run the Queries
1. Install the DuckDB CLI and open a terminal in the project root.
2. Run a script, for example: `duckdb -c ".read q1_sample.duckdb.sql"`
3. Review or tweak the scripts as needed to experiment with alternative queries or optimizations.

## Attribution and Usage Notice
